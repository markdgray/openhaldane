## Open-source dive computer

Project to create a functioning open-source scuba dive computer. 

The intention of this project is to open-source all aspects of the design including the hardware under the Apache license. The design will use, as much as possible, freely available components and open interfaces to build a modular design that will allow for the possibility of interchanging components. The first invocation uses components that I currently have available.

For an embedded device that requires accurate timing, the choice of Python as a programming language may seem like a strange one. This choice was made as I want to improve my Python coding skills.

# This should not be used as a primary or even secondary dive computer. :ok_hand:? . This project is merely a *science project*. Significant effort would be required to make this a reliable dive computer!
